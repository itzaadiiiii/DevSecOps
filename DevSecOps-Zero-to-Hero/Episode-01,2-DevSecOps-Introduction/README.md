## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It's an evolution of DevOps that makes security a shared responsibility across development, operations, and security teams.

### Core Principles

- **Automation First**: Automate security testing and compliance checks
- **Continuous Security**: Security is not a gate, it's continuous
- **Shift Left**: Find and fix security issues early in development
- **Shared Responsibility**: Everyone owns security, not just security teams
- **Fast Feedback**: Provide immediate security feedback to developers

### Traditional Security vs DevSecOps

| Traditional Security | DevSecOps |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Security at the end | Security from the start |
| Manual reviews | Automated scanning |
| Separate security team | Integrated security |
| Slow feedback loops | Real-time feedback |
| Blocks deployment | Enables secure deployment |

## Why DevSecOps is Important

### The Problem with Traditional Approaches

1. **Late Discovery**: Security issues found in production are 100x more expensive to fix
2. **Slow Releases**: Security becomes a bottleneck
3. **Siloed Teams**: Lack of collaboration leads to friction
4. **Compliance Gaps**: Manual processes miss vulnerabilities

### Benefits of DevSecOps

✅ **Reduced Risk**: Catch vulnerabilities before production
✅ **Faster Time to Market**: Security doesn't slow down releases
✅ **Cost Savings**: Fix issues early when they're cheaper
✅ **Better Compliance**: Automated compliance checks
✅ **Improved Culture**: Security becomes everyone's responsibility

### Real-World Impact

- **60%** reduction in security vulnerabilities
- **50%** faster time to remediation
- **30%** reduction in security-related costs
- **90%** of security checks automated

## Shift-Left Security

Shift-left means moving security testing earlier in the development process.

### The Security Shift-Left Pyramid

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Production (Runtime Security)     │  ← Most Expensive
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Pre-Production (Pen Testing)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   CI/CD Pipeline (Automated Tests)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Code Review (Peer Review)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   IDE (Developer Workstation)       │  ← Least Expensive
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Shift-Left Practices

1. **IDE Integration**
   - Real-time security linting
   - Vulnerability detection while coding
   - Secret detection before commit

2. **Pre-Commit Hooks**
   - Scan for secrets and credentials
   - Check for known vulnerabilities
   - Enforce coding standards

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
   - Container scanning

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Runtime security monitoring
   - Threat detection
   - Compliance monitoring

## Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identify, quantify, and address security risks.

### What is Threat Modeling?

A proactive security practice that helps you:
- Identify potential threats before they become vulnerabilities
- Understand your attack surface
- Prioritize security efforts
- Design secure architectures

### STRIDE Framework

STRIDE is a popular threat modeling methodology:

| Threat | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **S**poofing | Impersonating someone/something | Fake login credentials |
| **T**ampering | Modifying data or code | SQL injection |
| **R**epudiation | Denying actions | No audit logs |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Exposing sensitive data | Data leaks |
| **D**enial of Service | Making system unavailable | DDoS attacks |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized access | Privilege escalation |

### Threat Modeling Process

1. **Define Security Objectives**
   - What are you protecting?
   - What are the security requirements?

2. **Create Architecture Overview**
   - Draw data flow diagrams
   - Identify trust boundaries
   - Map entry/exit points

3. **Identify Threats**
   - Use STRIDE or other frameworks
   - Brainstorm potential attacks
   - Consider threat actors

4. **Mitigate Threats**
   - Design security controls
   - Implement countermeasures
   - Document decisions

5. **Validate**
   - Review with team
   - Test security controls
   - Update as system evolves

## Hands-On Lab

### Lab 1: Threat Modeling a Web Application

We'll threat model a simple e-commerce application.

#### Step 1: Define the System

**Application**: E-commerce web application
**Components**:
- Web frontend (React)
- API backend (Node.js)
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Payment gateway (Stripe)
- Authentication (OAuth 2.0)

#### Step 2: Create Data Flow Diagram

See `architecture/ecommerce-dataflow.md` for the complete diagram.

#### Step 3: Identify Threats Using STRIDE

Navigate to `threat-model/ecommerce-threats.md` for detailed threat analysis.

#### Step 4: Define Mitigations

Check `threat-model/mitigations.md` for security controls.

### Lab 2: Security Requirements Document

Create a security requirements document for your application:
- See template in `threat-model/security-requirements-template.md`
