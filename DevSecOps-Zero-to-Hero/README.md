## 📖 Episode 02 — DevSecOps Introduction

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-01,2-DevSecOps-Introduction/`

**Topics Covered:**
- What is DevSecOps?
- What is the full course about — episode-by-episode overview
- DevOps vs DevSecOps — how security fits into DevOps
- Shift-Left Security — why finding bugs early saves time and money
- Overview of tools we'll use throughout the course
- How the pipeline works end-to-end (Code → Scan → Build → Deploy → Monitor)

## 🔐 Episode 03 — Secure CI/CD Pipeline

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-03-Secure-CICD-Pipeline/`

**Topics Covered:**
- End-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a React Weather App
- Pipeline flow: Code → GitHub → Jenkins → Security Scans → Docker → ECR → Kubernetes → DAST
- Tools integrated in the pipeline:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| SonarQube | SAST — static code analysis |
| Snyk | Dependency vulnerability scanning |
| Gitleaks | Secret detection in code |
| Trivy | Container image vulnerability scanning |
| Checkov | IaC (Kubernetes YAML) scanning |
| OWASP ZAP | DAST — dynamic testing of live app |
| Falco | Runtime security monitoring |

- Jenkins pipeline stages (14 stages from checkout to DAST)
- Docker image build and push to Amazon ECR
- Kubernetes deployment on EC2 with k3s

**Key Takeaway:** Every stage of CI/CD has a security check — no code reaches production without being scanned.

---

## 🔒 Episode 04 — Git Security

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-04-git/`

**Topics Covered:**
1. **.gitignore** — Prevent sensitive files from being tracked
2. **Pre-Commit Hook (Basic)** — Custom hook to block commits with secrets
3. **Pre-Commit Framework + Gitleaks** — Automated secret scanning before every commit
4. **Gitleaks Repository Scan** — Scan entire repo history for leaked secrets
5. **GitHub Actions** — Automate Gitleaks in CI/CD on push and PR
6. **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** — Control who can access/modify the repo
7. **Branch Protection** — Require PRs, reviews, and status checks before merge
8. **CODEOWNERS** — Auto-assign reviewers based on file ownership
9. **Dependabot** — Automatically update vulnerable dependencies

**Key Takeaway:** Security starts at the developer's machine — pre-commit hooks catch secrets before they ever reach GitHub.

## 🐳 Episode 05 — Container Security

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-05-Container-Security/`

**Topics Covered:**

### Section 1: Non-Root Containers (15 min)
- Why running as root is dangerous
- Creating non-root users in Dockerfiles
- `USER` directive, `--chown` flag
- Verifying with `whoami`, `id`, `docker inspect`
- Read-only filesystem with `--read-only`

### Section 2: Image Size Optimization (20 min)
- **Multi-Stage Builds** — Build in one image, run in another (900MB → 15MB)
- **Distroless Images** — No shell, no package manager, no OS tools
- **Attack Surface Reduction** — `.dockerignore`, pinned versions, minimal packages

### Section 3: Image Scanning (25 min)
- **CVEs** — What they are, severity levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Trivy** — Scan images, filter by severity, fail CI/CD on critical CVEs
- **OSV Scanner** — Google's dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Trivy vs OSV Scanner** — When to use which
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated scanning

**Hands-On Images Built:**
```
myapp:insecure   — ❌ Root, full image, ~900MB
myapp:secure     — ✅ Non-root, multi-stage, slim, ~200MB
myapp:distroless — ✅ No shell, static binary, ~15MB
```

**Key Takeaway:** Smaller image = fewer vulnerabilities = smaller attack surface. Always run as non-root.

## ☸️ Episode 06 — Kubernetes Security

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-06-Kubernetes-Security/`

**Topics Covered:**
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** — Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings
- **Network Policies** — Control pod-to-pod communication
- **Pod Security Standards** — Restricted, Baseline, Privileged
- **Secrets Management** — Kubernetes secrets, external secret stores
- **Service Account Security** — Disable auto-mount, least privilege

**Key Takeaway:** Kubernetes is not secure by default — you must explicitly restrict access, network, and pod privileges.

---

## 🏗️ Episode 07 — Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-07-IaC-Security/`

**Topics Covered:**
- **Terraform Security** — Insecure vs Secure configurations
- **Checkov** — Scan Terraform/Kubernetes files for misconfigurations
- **Common IaC Mistakes:**
  - Open security groups (0.0.0.0/0)
  - Unencrypted S3 buckets
  - Public RDS instances
  - Missing logging/monitoring
- **Compliance as Code** — Enforce security policies automatically

**Key Takeaway:** Infrastructure misconfigurations are the #1 cause of cloud breaches — scan IaC before applying.

---

## 🛡️ Episode 08 — Runtime Security

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-08-Runtime-Security/`

**Topics Covered:**

### Section 1: Linux Capabilities (15 min)
- What capabilities are (breaking root into smaller privileges)
- Default Docker capabilities vs dangerous ones
- `--cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=<only-needed>` pattern
- Capabilities in Docker Compose and Kubernetes

### Section 2: Seccomp Profiles (20 min)
- System call filtering — block dangerous syscalls
- Docker's default seccomp profile (blocks ~44 syscalls)
- Custom seccomp profiles (deny by default, allow only needed)
- Seccomp in Kubernetes pods

### Section 3: AppArmor (15 min)
- Mandatory Access Control — restrict file/network access per process
- Docker's default AppArmor profile
- Custom AppArmor profiles for nginx
- Enforce vs Complain mode

### Section 4: Falco (10 min)
- Runtime threat detection using eBPF
- Detect: shell in container, sensitive file reads, crypto mining, reverse shells
- Custom Falco rules
- Helm deployment on Kubernetes

**Key Takeaway:** Even after deployment, containers need runtime protection — capabilities, seccomp, AppArmor, and Falco work together to detect and prevent attacks.

## 🚀 Episode 09 — End-to-End DevSecOps Pipeline

**📁 Folder:** `Episode-9-End-to-End-DevSecOps-Pipeline/`

**Topics Covered:**
- Complete production-ready pipeline integrating ALL previous episodes
- Full security automation from commit to production
- Pipeline: Code → Secret Scan → SAST → SCA → Build → Container Scan → IaC Scan → Deploy → DAST → Runtime Monitoring
- Incident response and alerting
- Continuous monitoring and compliance

**Key Takeaway:** DevSecOps is not one tool — it's the integration of security at every layer, automated end-to-end.
